# AnkitaInvestigator_PersonalInfo
Streamlined key information about myself using Python (JSON and GET requests) algorithms to create an interactive interface as an introductory project to HTML/CSS.
First real project based heavily in Python, HTML, and CSS.
Ultimate goal was to expose myself to new interfaces and provide an interactive, light-hearted, and humourous way for new people to learn about me.

Completed Septemeber 2021.
